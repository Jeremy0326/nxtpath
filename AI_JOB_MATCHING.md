# Advanced AI Job Matching Implementation

## Overview

The NxtPath platform now features an advanced AI-powered job matching system that goes beyond traditional keyword matching. This system uses state-of-the-art natural language processing and machine learning techniques to provide more accurate and personalized job recommendations to users.

## Architecture

The AI job matching system consists of three main components:

1. **CV Parser**: Uses LLMs to extract structured data from resumes, including skills, experience, education, and projects.
2. **Embedding Service**: Creates vector embeddings for both CVs and job descriptions to enable semantic search.
3. **Job Matcher**: Matches CVs to job descriptions using both semantic search and detailed LLM analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **LangChain**: Framework for building LLM applications
- **OpenAI API**: For LLM-based text generation and analysis
- **Sentence Transformers**: For creating high-quality text embeddings
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files

## Features

### 1. Semantic CV Parsing

The system uses LLMs to extract structured information from resumes, including:
- Personal information (name, contact details)
- Education history
- Work experience
- Skills and certifications
- Projects and achievements
- Languages spoken

This structured data enables more accurate matching and analysis.

### 2. Semantic Search

The system uses vector embeddings to find semantically similar jobs based on the content of the user's CV. This approach goes beyond simple keyword matching by understanding the meaning and context of the text.

### 3. Detailed Match Analysis

For each potential job match, the system provides:
- Overall match score (0-100%)
- Match reasons explaining why the job is a good fit
- Missing skills that the candidate should acquire
- Highlighted skills from the CV that match the job requirements
- Experience match assessment
- Education match assessment
- Improvement suggestions for the candidate's CV

### 4. Personalized Recommendations

The system takes into account the candidate's preferences, experience level, and career goals to provide personalized job recommendations.

## Phase 3: Model Development

### 1. Matching Algorithm Design
- [ ] Develop content-based filtering algorithm
- [ ] Implement cosine similarity matching between job and CV vectors
- [ ] Create weighted scoring system for different matching factors
- [ ] Develop hybrid recommendation system combining:
  - Content-based matching
  - Collaborative filtering based on similar users
  - Context-aware recommendations

### 2. Machine Learning Model
- [ ] Train classification model to predict job-candidate fit
- [ ] Implement feature importance analysis
- [ ] Develop match score calculation algorithm
- [ ] Create explainable AI component to justify match scores

### 3. Personalization
- [ ] Incorporate user preferences into matching algorithm
- [ ] Implement feedback loop from user interactions
- [ ] Develop personalized ranking algorithm
- [ ] Create user similarity metrics for collaborative filtering

## Phase 4: Implementation and Integration

### 1. Backend API Development
- [ ] Design RESTful API endpoints for job matching
- [ ] Implement job recommendation endpoint
- [ ] Create match score calculation endpoint
- [ ] Develop batch processing for periodic matching updates

### 2. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Design and implement job matching UI components
- [ ] Create match score visualization
- [ ] Develop job recommendation cards
- [ ] Implement filters and sorting for recommendations

### 3. Real-time Processing
- [ ] Set up job matching queue for new CVs
- [ ] Implement real-time matching for new job postings
- [ ] Create notification system for new matches

## Phase 5: Evaluation and Optimization

### 1. Metrics and Evaluation
- [ ] Define success metrics (click-through rate, application rate)
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework
- [ ] Create dashboard for matching performance
- [ ] Set up logging for model performance

### 2. Feedback Loop
- [ ] Collect user feedback on recommendations
- [ ] Implement explicit feedback collection (ratings)
- [ ] Track implicit feedback (clicks, applications)
- [ ] Use feedback to retrain and improve models

### 3. Optimization
- [ ] Optimize algorithm performance
- [ ] Implement caching for frequent recommendations
- [ ] Improve matching speed for real-time recommendations
- [ ] Fine-tune model parameters based on feedback

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

### 1. Career Path Recommendations
- [ ] Analyze career progression patterns
- [ ] Recommend next career steps based on CV
- [ ] Suggest skill development opportunities
- [ ] Create personalized career roadmaps

### 2. Skill Gap Analysis
- [ ] Compare user skills with job requirements
- [ ] Identify missing skills for desired positions
- [ ] Recommend learning resources for skill development
- [ ] Track skill development progress

### 3. Market Insights
- [ ] Analyze job market trends
- [ ] Provide insights on in-demand skills
- [ ] Show salary benchmarks for roles
- [ ] Generate reports on industry growth areas
